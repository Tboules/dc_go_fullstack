# Golang Fullstack Desert Collections

The plan is the build this application with 3 stacks. I want to take the app from start to finish in each.
The issue has been that every time I star this project, I only get part way and so this three fold build is important to me.

> ## The Goal
>
> Overall it is important that I learn what backend / fullstack infrastructure I actually prefer.
> The only way to actually do that is to engage in that process from start to finish multiple times with the same project.
