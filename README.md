# Golang Fullstack Desert Collections

The plan is to build this application with 3 stacks, 1 in Go, 1 in Next(Server Actions), 1 in Sveltkit(maybe lol). I want to take the app from start to finish in each.
The issue has been that every time I start this project, I only get part way and so this three fold build is important to me.

> Overall it is important that I learn what backend / fullstack infrastructure I actually prefer.
> The only way to actually do that is to engage in that process from start to finish multiple times with the same project.
